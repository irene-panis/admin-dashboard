This project initially started out as an admin dashboard layout, but halfway through creating it I decided to make it more of a social media mock-up.

I was inspired by Letterboxd to design a website called NoSkips, the music equivalent to Letterboxd. Essentially, users would be able to look up albums and rate them
or leave reviews. Like Letterboxd, NoSkips would also act as a diary of sorts for users to keep track of what albums they've listened to.

For this project I utilized Grid, a tiny bit of Flexbox, and the usual HTML/CSS.

This was genuinely a lot of fun to make and I can't get over how good it looks. I think I'd like to go back to this project someday and incorporate a dark mode, as
well as make it functional (though I've got a long way to go before I can do that)!
